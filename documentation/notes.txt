1. Did you compute the density back into exp? What you are computing is of course log-density, so comparing to KDE you need to compute exp(\sum_i \alpha_i \phi_i(x)) - Done

2. Put the color legend next to emages. The pictures don't tell much otherwise - TODO

For gaussian: 

how many points do you generate? 

Toy Data Set: 5000

how many MCMC iterations? 

iter=10000
burn=100
thin=5

How far is the emprirical expected value of the basis functions you are computing with MCMC from true expected value?

-> Printed in the output log

Is everyhing I need to repeat the test on Gitlab repository? How do I run the test? - I think so


python sgdensity.py --mode density --data data/toy2.txt --level 3

python sgdensity.py --mode density --data data/ripleyGarcke.train.arff.gz --level 3
